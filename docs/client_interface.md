# Client Interface

Game control is emplemented using prompts (aka menus)

At any moment of the game you can type `Ctrl+C`, which causes keyboard interrupt and shows menu with multiple choices of actions (also `Ctrl+C` will close any menu)

In response to some events in the game particular prompts will appear automatically, e.g. at the beginning of vote for mafia phase each client will see the menu with other players as options he/she can vote for. But in general you can always type `Ctrl+C` and choose from available actions
